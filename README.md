## Animicons: Sprite Animations with Icon Fonts

I built a proof-of-concept for using icon fonts for sprite animations. The result feels a little _too gif-ish_ for my liking, but this is just a proof of concept. I could have added more frames to get a more fluid animation.

[View the result on CodePen](http://codepen.io/briangonzalez/pen/hdHKm). This is also a good how to.

Iâ€™ve included all of the necessary font files (processed with [FontPrep](http://fontprep.com)) and the .glyphs files (built using [Glyphs App](http://glyphsapp.com)).
